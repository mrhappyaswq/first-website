      <div id="profile-pic"></div>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Owen Herschelman</strong>, and I am a Junior studying electrical engineering at <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong>. I am also an App Developer and musician. The best way to contact me is through my email, <u>oehersch@gmail.com</u>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I started at <strong>San Diego Miramar Community College</strong>, where I studied the fundamentals and got my associate's degrees in Pre-Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. This fall, I am transferring to <strong>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona</strong>, where I plan to obtain my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I am a dedicated student, and in the last two years, I was able to complete 106 semester units.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="work">
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>I work at a machine shop as a shop hand and at a restaurant as a food distribution specialist (line cook). These jobs are supporting me through college and teaching me crucial skills such as time management, customer service, and attention to detail. I am searching for job or internship opportunities that will help me progress towards my goal of becoming an electrical engineer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="hobbies">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Outside of work and school, I play music, work out, code, and tinker with electronics. I play '80s rock / 2000s pop on guitar, and a wide range of genres on piano. I try to keep my body physically fit by weightlifting and going on hikes with my girlfriend. I also enjoy coding to build tools and apps that solve problems or automate tasks. One example of this is a Python script that looks at cars from Facebook Marketplace, then sends me push notifications of the listings that are good deals. Tinkering is another hobby of mine. I work on my car and enjoy buying soldering kits online and learning how the circuitry works.</p>

    <h3>NorthStar: Focus Tool</h3>
    <p>NorthStar is a free macOS app I made to help you focus on one task at a time. Basically it is a to-do list; however, the task you prioritize will remain on the screen at all times, so it keeps you on track. I made this app to help me focus, and it gives me all the customization I need. It's available on the MacOS App Store.

    </p>

<!--     <h3>Outline: Planner Tool</h3>
    <p>Outline is another app I made, this app is on the iOS App Store. The goal of this app is for the user to put in all their goals, tasks for each goal, desired times, and priority. Then there is a daily planner which fills in any time you didn't plan with your goals, based on priority. It helps balance work and fun with built-in logic.</p>

    <h3>Building My PC</h3>
    <p>To build my pc, I picked parts suited for programming and development, then put it all together. This project taught me the complexity of combining multiple systems, you need to ensure everything is compatible with each other part.</p>

    <h3>Stock Trading Neural Network</h3>
    <p>A side project where I trained a neural network using the NEAT Python library. It scrapes live stock data and interacts with a simulated trading environment to learn buy/sell behavior over time. Did it work? Well, not yet. I occasionally work on it in my free time, but I haven't given up yet. </p>
