      <div id="profile-pic"></div>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Owen Herschelman</strong>, and I am a student studying electrical engineering. I started at San Diego Miramar Community College, then transfered to <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong>. The best way to contact me is through my email, <u>oehersch@gmail.com</u>.</p>

    <div class="card" id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Electrical Engineering at <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong>. Previously, I studied at <strong>Miramar Community College</strong>, where I obtained my associate's degrees and completed the foundation coursework.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="work">
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>I work two part-time jobs â€” one at a restaurant and another at a machine shop. These experiences have taught me how to manage my time, work in fast-paced environments, and stay grounded while I pursue my goals in tech and engineering. The nice thing about the jobs is they pay me, so its helping me get through college.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="hobbies">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing guitar and piano. Music helps me relax and shift my mindset creatively. I also enjoy coding to build tools and apps that solve problems or automate tasks. I also do weightlifting and go on hikes with my girlfriend.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>NorthStar: Focus Tool</h3>
    <p>NorthStar is a free macOS app I made to help you focus on one task at a time. Basically it is a to-do list; however, the task you prioritize will remain on the screen at all times, so it keeps you on track. It's available on the App Store.</p>

    <h3>Outline: Planner Tool</h3>
    <p>Outline is another app I made, this app is on the iOS App Store. The goal of this app is for the user to put in all their goals, tasks for each goal, desired times, and priority. Then there is a daily planner which fills in any time you didn't plan with your goals, based on priority. It helps balance work and fun with built-in logic.</p>

    <h3>Building My PC</h3>
    <p>To build my pc, I picked parts suited for programming and development, then put it all together. This project taught me the complexity of combining multiple systems, you need to ensure everything is compatible with each other part.</p>

    <h3>Stock Trading Neural Network</h3>
    <p>A side project where I trained a neural network using the NEAT Python library. It scrapes live stock data and interacts with a simulated trading environment to learn buy/sell behavior over time. Did it work? Well, not yet. I occasionally work on it in my free time, but I haven't given up yet.</p>
