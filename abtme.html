      <div id="profile-pic"></div>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Owen Herschelman</strong>, and I am a Junior studying electrical engineering at <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong>. The best way to contact me is through my email, <u>oehersch@gmail.com</u>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I started higher education at <strong>San Diego Miramar Community College</strong>, where I studied the fundamentals and got my associate's degrees in Pre-Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. This fall, I am transferring to <strong>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona</strong>, where I plan to obtain my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="work">
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>I used to work at a machine shop as a shop hand and at a restaurant as a food distribution specialist (line cook). These jobs are supporting me through college and teaching me crucial skills such as time management, customer service, and high precision output. Interestingly enough, the attention to detail is about the same, whether itâ€™s a rocket part with a 3-micron tolerance or a taco that cannot have onions. Precision is precision! Currently, I am looking for freelance opportunities in web scraping or software development.</p>
