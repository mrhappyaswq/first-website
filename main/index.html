      <div id="profile-pic"></div>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Owen Herschelman</strong>, and I am a Junior studying electrical engineering at <strong>Cal Poly Pomona</strong>. The best way to contact me is through my email, <u>oehersch@gmail.com</u>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I started higher education at <strong>San Diego Miramar Community College</strong>, where I studied the fundamentals and got my associate's degrees in Pre-Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. This fall, I am transferring to <strong>California State Polytechnic University, Pomona</strong>, where I plan to obtain my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="work">
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>I work at a machine shop as a shop hand and at a restaurant as a food distribution specialist (line cook). These jobs are supporting me through college and teaching me crucial skills such as time management, customer service, and high precision output. Interestingly enough, the attention to detail is about the same, whether itâ€™s a rocket part with a 3-micron tolerance or a taco that cannot have onions. Precision is precision! I am searching for job or internship opportunities that will help me progress towards my goal of becoming an electrical engineer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="hobbies">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Outside of work and school, I play music, work out, code, and tinker with electronics. I play '80s rock / 2000s pop on guitar, and a wide range of genres on piano. I try to keep my body physically fit by weightlifting and going on hikes with my girlfriend. I also enjoy coding to solve problems or automate tasks. One example of this is a Python script I made to help me buy a car. It notifies my phone when it finds a good deal on Facebook Marketplace cars. Any other free time is spent working on my car and purchasing soldering kits to learn how the circuitry works.</p>

      <h3>NorthStar: Focus Tool</h3>
      <p>
        NorthStar is an app I made to help myself focus on one task at a time. NorthStar is a recursive to-do list, and when a task is pinned, it will remain on the screen at all times, so it keeps you on track. I made this app to help me focus, and thought other people might find it useful too so I put it on the Mac App Store.

      <h3>Rhombic Dodecahedron Lamp</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a custom lamp by putting individually addressable LEDs and a mirrored finish inside a rhombic dodecahedron I made. Used a microcontroller to program various light patterns that could be cycled using a button.

      <h3>Building My PC</h3>
      <p>
        To build my PC, I picked parts aimed towards programming, then put it all together. This project taught me the complexity of combining multiple systems and part compatibility.

      <h3>Stock Trading Neural Network</h3>
      <p>
        A side project where I trained a neural network to trade stocks using the NEAT Python library. It scrapes live stock data and interacts with a simulated trading environment I made to learn buy/sell behavior over time. Did it work? Well, not yet. I occasionally work on it in my free time, but I haven't given up yet.
